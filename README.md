Legend
======

[VIDEO!](https://vimeo.com/62370966) (With animated grass turned off due to lack of good-looking animations right now.)

A procedural generator for layered block-based worlds in Java. The worlds are 2D in the style of Zelda, with width, breadth, and depth, and can be viewed from the four cardinal directions.

Features beautifully animated trees and water--all made from blocks!
